The project uses Arduino and sensors, to monitor a plant inside a grow room display the data locally and connecting to the “thingspeak.com” API to show and store the data remotely as well as water the plant automatically when the soil is too dry.

The project is stil in developement, current upgrading the space to test the sistem in a proper growroom, as well as some sensors and the pump that i had problems before.
